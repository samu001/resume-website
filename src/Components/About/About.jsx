                    I'm a dedicated, outgoing software engineer. I have a
                    passion for everything programming and design related,
                    That's why I usually combine both of them in my projects. I
                    will finalize my bachelors in computer science next fall at
                    Florida International University. Aside from being a
                    developer, my hobbies are baseball, karting, reading and
                    enjoying challenging FromSoftware video games!
